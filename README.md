# ML_Flask_Deployment
Deployment of LSTM model to predict USD/TRY with Flask

Basic deployment of LSTM model developed with Keras/Python with Flask. 
<ul>
  <li>Templates folder include HTML files for web page.</li>
  <li>Model folder include trained and saved model for USD/TRY.</li>
  <li>app.py --> Flask application</li>
  <li>model.py --> Training and saving LSTM model</li>
  <li>usdtry.csv --> Dataset to train LSTM model</li>
 </ul>
